# Data Structures in C  

This repository contains my **implementations of core data structures and algorithms in C**.  
It is designed as a **learning project** to strengthen my understanding of:  
- Pointers  
- Dynamic memory allocation  
- Recursion  
- Memory management  
- Error handling  

Each section contains well-documented C code with examples.

## 📂 Contents  

1. **Recursion**  
   - Factorial, Fibonacci  
   - Tower of Hanoi  
   - Recursive traversal examples  

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**  
   - `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free` usage  
   - Implementing dynamic arrays  

3. **Linked List**  
   - Singly linked list (insert, delete, search, traverse, reverse)  
   - Doubly linked list  
   - Circular linked list  

4. **Memory Management & Error Handling**  
   - Handling null pointers

   - Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)  

7. **Heaps & Hashing**  
   - Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementation  
   - Heap sort  
   - Hash table with collision handling (chaining, open addressing)  

8. **Summary**

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:

A personal learning journey in C programming.

A reference for implementing data structures from scratch.

A portfolio project to demonstrate knowledge of algorithms, memory management, and problem solving.

Would you like me to also include a **progress checklist (✅/❌)** under each section, so you can mark off what you’ve already implemented as you go?
